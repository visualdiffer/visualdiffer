</div><h1 id="tocAnchor-1-1">Comparison Method</h1>

<p>It is possible to choose which method to use to compare two folders.<br />
The method to use is strictly related to user needs, comparing source code (files large only few kilobytes) should use a content comparison but to find which movies (files larger than a gigabytes) are not present on right side is faster compare by file size or file timestamp.</p>

<p>Every file is treated as binary and it is compared byte by byte, only 'Compare file content ignoring line ending differences' compares text.</p>

<p>The complete list of supported comparison methods</p>

<table class="bordered">
   <tr><th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file sizes
<br />Very quick</td>
<td>Two file are identical if they have the same file size</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file timestamps
<br />Very quick</td>
<td>Two file are identical if they have the same timestamp.
<br />It is used the Unix <strong>last modified date</strong> for comparison.
<br />If file A timestamp is less than file B it is marked as <strong>older</strong> and it will be shown with different color. 
<br />It is possible to set a span in seconds to consider two files with same timestamp, see below</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file timestamps and sizes
<br />Very quick</td>
<td>Compare the files timestamp, only if it is different then compare the size.</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file content only
<br />Slow on large files</td>
<td>Compare files as binary, byte by byte</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file timestamp, size and content
<br />Slow on large files</td>
<td>Compare the file content, only if content is different compare the timestamp and only if timestamp differs compare size</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Compare file content ignoring line ending differences
<br />Slow on large files</td>
<td>Compare file as plain text, read line by line and compare lines.
<br />The line ending character is ignored so a DOS file (with lines separated by CR+LF) matches an Unix file (with lines separated by LF) if, ignoring the newlines, the content is identical</td>
</tr>
</table><h1 id="tocAnchor-1-2">Compare Finder Metadata</h1>

<p>It is possible to compare OSX Finder Metadata.</p>

<p>When the metadata comparison mismatches, for example left file's label is red and right file's label is blue, the other comparison methods (size, timestamp, content) are not evaluated.</p>

<p>The complete list of supported metadata</p>

<table class="bordered">
   <tr><th>Metadata</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Label</td>
<td>Compare all labels assigned to a file</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Tags
<br /><strong>Available in OSX 10.9 or above</strong></td>
<td>Compare all tags assigned to a file</td>
</tr>
</table><h1 id="tocAnchor-1-3">Folders Traversal</h1>

<p>User can choose to not traverse special files like symbolic links and packages</p>

<table class="bordered">
   <tr><th>File</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Follow Symbolic Links</td>
<td>If checked the symbolic links will be traversed</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Skip Packages</td>
<td>If checked special OSX files (so called bundle or packages)
<br />like Applications and Frameworks will not be traversed</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Check Resource Forks</td>
<td>Check if files are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork">resource forks</a>, this can slow down the comparison.<br />
When this option is on if the file is a resource fork its size is determined from its structured data.
</td>
</tr>
</table><h1 id="tocAnchor-1-4">Timestamp Tolerance</h1>

<p>The timestamp comparison considers two files matching when the time (including the seconds) is identical but sometime it would be useful to have a range of tolerance for example when the difference is between 5 seconds.</p>

<p>You can set this tolerance entering a positive integer number into the text field</p>

<p>Ignore differences of X seconds or less</p>

<h1 id="tocAnchor-1-5">Choose Files to View according to differences found</h1>

<p>After the comparison complete you can choose which files to view</p>

<p>Definition: <strong>Orphan</strong> indicates a file present only on one side</p>

<p>The complete list of show options</p>

<table class="bordered">
   <tr><th>Choice</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Show All</td>
<td>No matters which comparison result, show files</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Only Mismatches</td>
<td>Show only files with some mismatch (size, timestamp or content)</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Only Matches</td>
<td>Show only identical files</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>No Orphans</td>
<td>Show files present both on left and right side</td>
</tr>
   <tr><td>Only Orphans</td>
<td>Show files present only on left or only on right</td>
</tr>
</table><h2 id="tocAnchor-1-5-1">Choose Folders to View</h2>

<p>It is possible to hide empty and orphans folders.
Folders can be empty because they don't contains any file on disk or because all files/folders inside them are filtered.<br />
Orphans folders are present only on one side (left or right)</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-5-2">Show Filtered Files</h2>

<p>When a filter founds matches the elements are not visible but in case it's necessary to shown them you can click on the <code>Filtered</code> button</p>

<p>Some files are excluded by defaults, the complete list is shown below.<br />
Default filters can be changed or totally deleted from <code>Session Preferences</code> window</p>

<table class="bordered">
   <tr><th>Description</th>
